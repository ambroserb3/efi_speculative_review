# Notes

- Prompt engineering is very difficult, particularly enforcing constraints, had to implement retries, stronger language, and possibly might add follow-up questions based on failures, and as a final failsafe text search.
- Lots of questions go into literary analysis that LLMs are not capable of answering, namely regarding reception/impact/reflection
- LLMs would be great for leveraging historical context, this is limited since my available metadata doesn't seem to contain publication date.
- sentiment analysis on the resulting long form answers may be worthwhile?
- Very consistent at some things like characters, but not as consistent the more subjective the topic nature
